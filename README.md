The data is based on the COVID-19 case counts as reported by the COVID Prison Project (CPP), with additional information about the ICE detention facilities collected from a variety of other sources (see information in “Data Sources” and “Terms” below).

There are two data files in this repository. The one entitled “all_cases.csv” includes the weekly case counts for all of the facilities included in the study. The one entitled “summary_data.csv” is summary statistics based on the case counts in “all_cases.csv” and was used for the main analysis in our publication. Each of the columns in these two documents is explained in the “Terms” section below. Also included in this repository is the R code that was used for determining the presence of outbreaks and statistical analysis. 

Please see the "data_dictionary.docx" file for additional explanation of the variables in the data files.
